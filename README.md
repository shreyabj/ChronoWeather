🏆 Achievements
1st Place – Eurekathon 2025 (Coding Track) for building ChronoWeather, recognized for impactful climate-tech innovation and real-world scalability.

🌩️ ChronoWeather
AI-Powered NASA Analog Forecasting System

ChronoWeather is an AI-driven climate intelligence platform that integrates NASA Earth data, analog-year forecasting, and real-time ground validation to deliver hyperlocal, route-specific, future-facing weather insights.
Winner – Eurekathon 2025 (Coding Track).

🚀 Features

NASA-Integrated Climate Engine — Uses 7+ NASA APIs (MERRA-2, MODIS, Giovanni GES) with 40+ years of historical data.

AI Analog Forecasting — Claude-powered “climate twin” model predicts future conditions using pattern similarity.

Route-Based Weather Simulation — Generates forecasts across multi-checkpoint routes with risk markers.

AR-Style Historical Replay — Visualizes decades of climate patterns for educational and research use.

Ground Truth Fusion — Combines satellite data with live user reports for real-time validation.

Global Scale — Hyperlocal (5 km) accuracy across 193 countries with high availability.
